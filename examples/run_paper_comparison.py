Paper Validation: 6G Autonomous vs Traditional Traffic Light System

This script runs the comprehensive comparison to validate the research paper's
hypothesis that 6G-enabled autonomous vehicles with signal-free intersections
outperform traditional traffic light controlled systems with human drivers.

Research Question: Do 6G-enabled autonomous vehicles with intelligent coordination
provide better traffic performance than traditional traffic light systems?

Expected Results Based on Paper:
- Reduced travel times (signal-free intersections)
- Lower waiting times (no red light delays)
- Higher throughput (continuous flow vs stop-and-go)
- Better traffic efficiency overall
